# Deployment

 -This project was developed using GitPod, which was then committed and pushed to GitHub using the GitPod terminal.

## Deploying on GitHub Pages
To deploy this page to GitHub Pages from its GitHub repository, the following steps were taken:

1. Locate the GitHub Repository.
2. At the top of the repository, select Settings from the menu items.
3. Scroll down the Settings page to the "Pages" section.
4. Under "Source" click the drop-down menu labelled "None" and select "Main".
5. Upon selection, the page will automatically refresh meaning that the website is now deployed.
6. Scroll back down to the "Pages" section to retrieve the deployed link.

Welcome USER_NAME,

This is the Code Institute student template for deploying your third portfolio project, the Python command-line project. The last update to this file was: **August 17, 2021**

## Reminders

* Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
* Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
* Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

-----
Happy coding!
